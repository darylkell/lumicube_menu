# lumicube_menu

What is it?
A menu system that can be employed for the (optional) rear screen of Abstract Foundry's Lumicube.

As the Lumicube has 3 rear buttons, the menu allows the top and bottom buttons to navigate on the rear screen, and the middle button to select an option from the menu that you have selected. In this way you can run scripts from the menu, instead of logging into the Lumicube's web interface.

The provided script demonstrates some default projects (by Abstract Foundry) that can be run from the menu.
